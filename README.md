# IGCapT
The IGCAPT allows electric utility personnel to perform a static analysis of their communications network supporting smart grid architectures from a network utilization and performance standpoint. IGCAPT is meant to be a "first order" planning tool - the tool will accommodate estimates and best available data alongside default settings, which the user can then improve over time.
